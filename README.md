# How To Upload Images to GitHub's CDN
1. First, visit any repository on GitHub and click your way through to the issues page.
2. Create a new issue by clicking the **New Issue** button. You'll now see title and description fields. 
3. Drag-and-drop an image on to the description field. This will start the uploading process.
4. Copy the URL and use it in README, issues or pull requests however you like.
